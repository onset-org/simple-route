## Contributing
This library is primarily intended for quick execution on the server side and is by no means considered safe. Written for yourself, to use only POST requests, and a possible form of login. **In no case is it considered professional software.**

## Requirements
* PHP 7.1 or greater (version 3.x and below supports PHP 5.5+)
* jQuery 3.5.0

## Features
* Basic routing (POST) with support jQery Ajax POST requests.
* All POST requests are processed through jQery Ajax.
* Two ways to process a request from **handler.php** and function **handler()** in *Basic\Router* Class.

## POST Handler
```php
# router.php

# namespace Basic;
# Class Router;
private function handler(){
   (isset($_POST['passwd']))? setcookie('key', md5($_POST['passwd'])) : print 'Error: null;';
   (isset($_POST['logout']))? setcookie('key', '') : print 'Error: null;';
}

# or handler.php
   (isset($_POST['passwd']))? setcookie('key', md5($_POST['passwd'])) : print 'Error: null;';
   (isset($_POST['logout']))? setcookie('key', '') : print 'Error: null;';
```
